# ANNA - Artificial Neural Network Abundances
Work in progress code to automatically parameterize stellar spectra using a convolutional neural network. Designed to be trained on synthetic stellar spectra with optional data augmentation including continuum error, radial velocity, and instrumental signal-to-noise profile. After training, ANNA can infer a user-specified number of atmospheric parameters from input spectra of the same form as the training data.
